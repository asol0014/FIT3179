From the distribution of lines, we see that Australia is well connected with Europe and Asia. Likewise, The United States is consistently in the top ten countries visitors come from. Conversely, Australia is less well connected with South American countries, with flights to 4 countries on the continent. The lack of flights to Africa is illustrated too, as currently the only direct route is from Johannesburg to Perth. Other African countries passengers could have travelled to via connecting flights were not in the dataset.</p>

    <div class="pure-u-11-12">
      <p style="color: #525252; font-family: FrutigerLTStd-Light">Evidently, the majority of international travellers have coem to Australia for recreational purposes like holidaying and visiting friends and relatives. Commercial related activites like attenidng conferences, working, and conducting business were less popular reasons for short term visitors. Strikingly, there is a large shift in the number of travellers arriving for other purposes or reasons not stated between 2006 and 2008. This change in trends continues, dropping back down to pre 2006 rates in 2018.</p>
      <p style="color: #525252; font-family: FrutigerLTStd-Light">Knowing that the COVID-19 pandemic was in 2020 and restrictions began easing in 2021, we can see many people travelled to Australia to visit friends and relatives, making up from trips cancelled the year prior.</p>

      <div class="pure-u-1-24"></div>
      <div class="pure-u-11-12">
            <p style="color: #525252; font-family: FrutigerLTStd-Light">Pictured below are commercial airports in Australia, and the number of domestic or international flights that have landed or taken off there since 1985. 
              Sydney Airport is Australia's busiest airport, with Melbourne and Brisbane following. This is unsurprising, as Sydney opened its international airport in the late 1940s, whilst Melbourne opened its doors to international travellers in 1970 when its international airport was unveiled.</p>
            <p style="color: #525252; font-family: FrutigerLTStd-Light">These maps also illustrate how Australia's airports are concentrated along the East Coast, which aligns with how approximately 80% of Australians live on the East Coast of the country. Note that not all airports have domestic and international terminals, and some international flights service few international routes. For example, Hobart's only regular international flight is between Aukland New Zealand. Simiarly, whilst Townsville has international airport status, it has no regular scheduled passenger flights currently.</p>

      <h3 class="grey-background">How has the popularity of air travel changed in Australia?</h3>
      <div class="pure-u-1-24"></div>
      <div class="pure-u-11-12">
        <p style="color: #525252; font-family: FrutigerLTStd-Light">With Sydney Airport clearly the busiest airport in the country, with just shy of 10 million flights in and out since its opening, catching a flight to travel the country or abroad is clearly a popular undertaking. But air travel has not always been this popular or abundant. To service these passengers, the number of flights departing Australian airports over time has almost doubled since 1985.</p>
      <p style="color: #525252; font-family: FrutigerLTStd-Light">That said, flashpoints in history have moulded this number, with the number of flights departing and arriving in the country slowing at 3 distinct points since 1985. Firstly, you'll notice the COVID-19 pandemic caused the most significant drop in March 2020, due to restrictions and risks with international travel for the threat to health it caused. The 9/11 attacks in America also marked a reduction in flights, again with threats to safety in air travel and worry caused by the attacks. In both instances, their impacts are felt years after with pre-COVID flight numbers only just returning, and the post 9/11 flight numbers recovering almost 3 years later.</p>
      </div>
      <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Switch between different airports to see how flights decreased more or less, and how long they took to recover from these historical events.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="pure-u-1-1">
      <div id="vis3" class="vis-container"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="pure-u-1-24"></div>
    <div class="pure-u-22-24">
      <p style="color: #525252; font-family: FrutigerLTStd-Light">Note also the decline in August and September 1989, which was caused by a pilots' strike in Australia. The pilots argued that if the government treated them the same way it treated other employee groups, they would only work the standard hours of those groups, 9 to 5. A few days before the strikes began on 18 August 1989, former Prime Minister Bob Hawke allowed Royal Australian Air Force and international flights to operate in order to ease disruptions, rather than negotiating agreements with the pilots. Ultimately, agreements were never negotiated and the dispute was resolved after many pilots resigned to avoid potential litigation from their employers. The strikes had a significant impact on the tourism sector, particularly domestic tourism, highlighting the strong interconnection and dependence between the aviation and tourism industries.</p>

      <div class="pure-u-1-24"></div>
      <div class="pure-u-11-12">
        <p style="color: #525252; font-family: FrutigerLTStd-Light">Only some events that impacted flight numbers show a decline in the number of passengers travelling. Most obviously, the COVID-19 pandemic reduced the number of international travellers significantly, as people were in lockdown. Zooming into the time after the 9/11 attacks, passenger numbers continued on their same trend, suggesting whilst there were less flights, those flights were more full. Potentially, it was the lack of flights to and from other countries causing the decline in 2001 illustrated earlier. The lack of a drop in 1989 reflects how it was largely domestic tourism in Australia that was impacted by the Australian pilots strike.</p>
        <p style="color: #525252; font-family: FrutigerLTStd-Light">The charts below also allow you to explore COVID-19 pandemic recovery and compare states and their recovery periods. Airports in states with strict lockdowns like Sydney and Melbourne have had steady recovery periods, knowing their operations make up the majority of Australia's international flights.</p>

      <div class="pure-u-22-24">
        <p style="color: #525252; font-family: FrutigerLTStd-Light">Indeed, there is a trend between years for the most popular time to travel! january, July, October, and December consistently are the top 4 busiest months for travel, for both tourists arriving and people departing. December and January align with both holiday periods where people may have time off or travel to see family and friends to celebrate events together, whilst tourists may aim to visit Australia during its warmer months. With July and October also in the top 4, it seems travel in the second half of the year is more popular than the first half.</p>
        <p style="color: #525252; font-family: FrutigerLTStd-Light">This series also underscores the increase in popularity of travel in Asutralia - in ust 40 years the number of international flights has doubled, making Australia more connected than ever with the world.</p>
