Likewise, The United States is consistently in the top ten countries visitors come from. Conversely, Australia is less well connected with South American countries, with flights to four countries on the continent. The lack of flights to Africa is illustrated too, as currently the only direct route is from Johannesburg to Perth. Other African countries passengers could have travelled to via connecting flights were not in the dataset.</p>

Commercial related activites like attending conferences, working, and conducting business were less popular reasons for short term visitors. Strikingly, there is a large shift in the number of travellers arriving for other purposes or reasons reasons not stated between 2006 and 2008. This change in trends continues, dropping back down to pre 2006 rates in 2018.</p>
        <p style="color: #525252; font-family: FrutigerLTStd-Light">Knowing that the COVID-19 pandemic was in 2020 and restrictions began easing in 2021, we can see a <b style="color: black;">spike in the proportion of people travelling to Australia to visit friends and relatives</b> that year, perhaps making up from trips cancelled the year prior.</p>

              <p style="color: #525252; font-family: FrutigerLTStd-Light">Pictured below are commercial airports in Australia, and the number of domestic or international flights that have landed or taken off there since 1985. 
                <b style="color: black;">Sydney Airport is Australia's busiest airport, with Melbourne and Brisbane following</b>. This is unsurprising, as Sydney opened its international airport in the late 1940s, whilst Melbourne opened its doors to international travellers in 1970 when its international airport was unveiled. These airports also service Australia's largest cities.</p>
              <p style="color: #525252; font-family: FrutigerLTStd-Light">These maps also illustrate how Australia's airports are concentrated along the East Coast, which aligns with how approximately <b style="color: black;">80% of Australians live on the East Coast</b>. Note that not all airports have domestic and international terminals, and some international flights service few international routes. For example, Hobart's only regular international flight is between Aukland New Zealand. Simiarly, whilst Townsville has international airport status, it has no regular scheduled passenger flights currently.</p>

      <h3 class="grey-background">How has the popularity of air travel changed in Australia?</h3>
      <div class="pure-u-1-24"></div>
      <div class="pure-u-11-12">
        <p style="color: #525252; font-family: FrutigerLTStd-Light">With Sydney Airport clearly the busiest airport in the country, with just shy of 10 million flights in and out since its opening, catching a flight to travel the country or abroad is clearly a popular undertaking. But air travel has not always been this popular or abundant. To service these passengers, <b style="color: black;">the number of flights departing Australian airports over time has almost doubled since 1985</b>.</p>
      <p style="color: #525252; font-family: FrutigerLTStd-Light"><b style="color: black;">Flashpoints in history have moulded this number</b>, with the number of flights departing and arriving in the country slowing at three distinct points since 1985. Firstly, you'll notice the <b style="color: black;">COVID-19 pandemic</b> caused the most significant drop in March 2020, due to restrictions and risks with international travel for the threat to health it caused. The <b style="color: black;">9/11 attacks</b> in America also marked a reduction in flights, again with threats to safety in air travel and worry caused by the attacks. In both instances, their impacts are felt years after with pre-COVID flight numbers only just returning, and the post 9/11 flight numbers recovering almost three years later.</p>
      </div>
      <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Switch between different airports to see how flights decreased more or less, and how long they took to recover from these historical events.</p>

    <div class="pure-u-22-24">
      <p style="color: #525252; font-family: FrutigerLTStd-Light">The decline in August and September 1989 was caused by a pilots striking as in Australia as part of the <b style="color: black;">1989 Australian pilots' dispute</b>. Pilots were arguing that if the government treated them the same way it treated other employee groups, they would only work the standard hours of those groups, 9 to 5. A few days before the strikes began on 18 August 1989, former Prime Minister Bob Hawke allowed Royal Australian Air Force and international flights to operate in order to ease disruptions, rather than negotiating agreements with the pilots.</p>
      <p style="color: #525252; font-family: FrutigerLTStd-Light">Ultimately, agreements were never negotiated and the dispute was resolved after many pilots resigned to avoid potential litigation from their employers. The strikes had a significant impact on the tourism sector, particularly domestic tourism, highlighting the <b style="color: black;">strong interconnection and dependence between the aviation and tourism industries</b>.</p>

        <p style="color: #525252; font-family: FrutigerLTStd-Light">Only some events that impacted flight numbers show a decline in the number of passengers travelling. Most strikingly, the <b style="color: black;">COVID-19 pandemic reduced the number of international travellers dramatically</b>, as people were in lockdown. Zooming into the time after the 9/11 attacks, passenger numbers continued on their same trend, suggesting whilst there were less flights, those flights were more full. Potentially, it was the <b style="color: black;">lack of flights to and from other countries causing the decline in 2001</b> illustrated earlier. The lack of a drop in 1989 reflects how it was <b style="color: black;">largely domestic tourism in Australia that was impacted by the Australian pilots strike</b>.</p>
        <p style="color: #525252; font-family: FrutigerLTStd-Light">The charts below also allow you to explore COVID-19 pandemic recovery and <b style="color: black;">compare states and their recovery periods</b>.

        <p style="color: #525252; font-family: FrutigerLTStd-Light">Indeed, there is a trend between years for the most popular time to travel. <b style="color: black;">January, July, October, and December are consistently the top four busiest months for travel</b>, for both tourists arriving and people departing. December and January align with both holiday periods where people may have time off or travel to see family and friends to celebrate together. Tourists may visit Australia in these months due to it being warmer too. With July and October also in the top four, it seems travel in the second half of the year is more popular than the first half.</p>
